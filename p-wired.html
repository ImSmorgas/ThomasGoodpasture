                    <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
                        My deep affection for my city, Chattanooga, is surpassed only by my admiration for the
                        flourishing small businesses that
                        contribute to its warmth and friendliness. These local establishments are the heartbeat of our
                        community. One such
                        favorite of mine is Wired Coffee Bar, which has been a cherished spot since its opening in
                        Ooltewah back in 2014.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
                        One observation I've made is that many of these small businesses have websites that may not
                        reflect their unique charm.
                        Eager to contribute to the enhancement of my city, I aim to utilize my web design skills to
                        bring polish and personality
                        to these businesses' online presence. My mission for this project is clear â€“ to create websites
                        that exude personality,
                        exhibit polish, and prioritize usability. I believe this can empower local businesses to not
                        only stand out but also
                        compete effectively against larger chains.

                    </div>
                    <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
                        Wired Coffee Bar's existing website lacks a dedicated menu. Currently, the only available
                        menu is on a mobile ordering
                        platform, which does not comprehensively showcase all their offerings. The "choose how you
                        want to get wired" section,
                        while informative about drink styles, falls short in presenting the full array of products.
                        It primarily focuses on hot,
                        iced, frozen, and tea options, neglecting the diverse and delightful range of food and
                        specialty drinks that Wired has
                        to offer.

                    <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
                        The top bar navigation on the website is deficient in several key UI design principles.
                        Notably, it lacks crucial
                        elements such as alignment, balance, and emphasis. Moreover, its functionality falls short
                        as it primarily redirects
                        users to a similar location that could be more effectively presented in a dedicated about or
                        contact page. Enhancing the
                        alignment, balance, and emphasis in the navigation, while reorganizing content to more
                        appropriate sections, would
                        contribute to a more user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing website.

                    <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
                        The unusually sized headers scattered across the pages are visually jarring. They draw
                        attention to broader image sizing
                        issues throughout the website, highlighting inconsistencies in uniformity and alignment.
                        Addressing these concerns would
                        significantly enhance the overall visual coherence and user experience on the site.

                    <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
                        The website is currently lacking in the application of essential UI design principles.
                        Notably, alignment and balance stand out as significant visual
                        discrepancies. The overall impression is akin to a webpage hanging on by a crooked thread,
                        with only a hint of
                        excitement to loosely bind everything together. Addressing these issues and incorporating a
                        thoughtful implementation of
                        the design principles will contribute to a more cohesive and visually engaging website.

                            Beginning from the top, a comprehensive redesign of the navbar has been implemented.
                            This includes the integration of
                            the company logo, the addition of new web pages, and the incorporation of active and
                            hover styling for improved user
                            interaction. The previously oversized headers have been replaced with a more
                            user-friendly Jumbotron-style header,
                            providing a familiar and welcoming impression. Directly below, a section has been
                            introduced to offer insights into the
                            company's commitment to quality. Immediately following, a strategic page redirect has
                            been included, allowing users to
                            seamlessly navigate to the menu and explore the full range of products offered by the

                            The addition of a story section to the homepage is in progress. However, its current
                            integration feels disjointed due to
                            a lack of contrast. As part of the ongoing Wired project, I am actively brainstorming
                            additional sections that would
                            contribute valuable information. This strategic approach aims to introduce more
                            separation between the existing
                            sections, ensuring a more cohesive and visually pleasing layout. Stay tuned for further
                            updates as the project evolves.

                            In designing the menu, my goal was to evoke the appearance of items presented on a sheet
                            of paper. I opted for a card
                            system that incorporates essential information such as an image, title, price, and
                            description. Due to the use of stock
                            images, maintaining a consistent brand focus posed challenges during the menu creation.
                            However, the setup is flexible
                            and allows for easy adjustments if necessary, ensuring adaptability as the project
                            progresses.

                        With a strong focus on streamlining the design process for ease of development, this project
                        came together remarkably
                        smooth. Surpassing my self-assigned one-week deadline, I successfully coded the bulk of
                        the project within just four
                        days, all while juggling the demanding schedule of a college student.

                        Having three additional days at my disposal, I opted to enhance the website further without
                        altering its core structure.
                        Recognizing my appreciation for web animations as a user, I invested time in learning and
                        implementing them into my
                        project. This decision not only added a captivating element to the website but also served
                        as an opportunity to expand
                        my skill setâ€”a valuable addition to my toolkit.
